# ITPM Assignment 1 - Singlish to Sinhala Translation Testing

## Student Information
•⁠  ⁠*Registration Number*: IT23390782
•⁠  ⁠*Assignment*: IT3040 - ITPM Assignment 1
•⁠  ⁠*Objective*: Test the Singlish to Sinhala translation system at https://www.swifttranslator.com/

## Project Overview

This project contains automated tests using Playwright to evaluate the accuracy and stability of a Singlish to Sinhala translation system. The test suite includes:

•⁠  ⁠*24 Positive Functional Tests*: Scenarios where the system correctly converts Singlish to Sinhala
•⁠  ⁠*10Negative Functional Tests*: Scenarios where the system fails or behaves incorrectly
•⁠  ⁠*1 UI Tests*: Tests for real-time translation behavior and user interface functionality

### Test Coverage

The test suite comprehensively covers:

1.⁠ ⁠*Sentence Structures*
   - Simple, compound, and complex sentences
   - Interrogative (questions) and imperative (commands) forms
   - Positive and negative sentence forms

2.⁠ ⁠*Daily Language Usage*
   - Common greetings, requests, and responses
   - Polite vs informal phrasing
   - Frequently used day-to-day expressions

3.⁠ ⁠*Word Combinations & Patterns*
   - Multi-word expressions and collocations
   - Joined vs segmented word variations
   - Repeated word expressions for emphasis

4.⁠ ⁠*Grammatical Forms*
   - Tense variations (past, present, future)
   - Negation patterns
   - Singular/plural usage and pronoun variations
   - Request forms with varying politeness

5.⁠ ⁠*Input Length Variations*
   - Short inputs (≤ 30 characters)
   - Medium inputs (31–299 characters)
   - Long inputs (≥ 300 characters)

6.⁠ ⁠*Mixed Language Content*
   - English technical/brand terms embedded in Singlish
   - Place names and common English words
   - English abbreviations and short forms

7.⁠ ⁠*Formatting & Special Cases*
   - Punctuation marks
   - Currency, time formats, dates
   - Multiple spaces, line breaks, paragraph inputs
   - Slang and colloquial phrasing

## Prerequisites

•⁠  ⁠Node.js (v16 or higher)
•⁠  ⁠npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1.⁠ ⁠Clone this repository:
⁠ bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd IT23390782-ITPM
 ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Install dependencies:
⁠ bash
npm install
 ⁠

3.⁠ ⁠Install Playwright browsers:
⁠ bash
npx playwright install
 ⁠

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:
⁠ bash
npm test
 ⁠

### Run specific test suites:

*Positive functional tests only:*
⁠ bash
npm run test:positive
 ⁠

*Negative functional tests only:*
⁠ bash
npm run test:negative
 ⁠

*UI tests only:*
⁠ bash
npm run test:ui
 ⁠

### Run tests in headed mode (see browser):
⁠ bash
npm run test:headed
 ⁠

### Debug tests:
⁠ bash
npm run test:debug
 ⁠

### View test report:
⁠ bash
npm run report
 ⁠

## Test Results

After running tests, an HTML report will be automatically generated. You can view it by running:
⁠ bash
npm run report
 ⁠

The report includes:
•⁠  ⁠Test execution status (Pass/Fail)
•⁠  ⁠Execution time
•⁠  ⁠Screenshots on failure
•⁠  ⁠Detailed error messages

## Test Case Documentation

All test cases are documented according to the assignment template with the following information:
•⁠  ⁠Test Case ID
•⁠  ⁠Test case name
•⁠  ⁠Input length type (S/M/L)
•⁠  ⁠Input text (Singlish)
•⁠  ⁠Expected output (Sinhala)
•⁠  ⁠Actual output
•⁠  ⁠Status (Pass/Fail)
•⁠  ⁠Accuracy justification/Description of issue
•⁠  ⁠Coverage categories

## Notes

•⁠  ⁠Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers by default
•⁠  ⁠Each test waits for the page to fully load before executing
•⁠  ⁠Real-time translation updates are validated with appropriate wait conditions
•⁠  ⁠The system is designed for standard Singlish transliteration and may not handle chat-style shorthand

## Browser Configuration

The tests are configured to run on:
•⁠  ⁠Chromium (Desktop Chrome)
•⁠  ⁠Firefox (Desktop Firefox)
•⁠  ⁠WebKit (Desktop Safari)

To run on a specific browser:
⁠ bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
 ⁠

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail to run:

1.⁠ ⁠Ensure all dependencies are installed:
⁠ bash
npm install
npx playwright install
 ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Check your internet connection (tests require access to https://www.swifttranslator.com/)

3.⁠ ⁠Verify Node.js version:
⁠ bash
node --version  # Should be v16 or higher
 ⁠

4.⁠ ⁠Clear Playwright cache and reinstall:
⁠ bash
npx playwright install --force
 ⁠
